## imgex

ImgEx (Image Extractor) does exactly as its name implies. 
It extracts all images (and gifs) larger than a given dimension on webpages 
within a certain link distance (depth) from the input link.
All visited pages must also share the same hostname as the input link.

This program uses the [xcrawl module](https://github.com/mingkaic/xcrawl), an extensible web crawler.
